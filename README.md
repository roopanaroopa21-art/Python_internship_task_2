Python Data Types Demonstration

📌 Internship Project

This repository contains a simple Python script created as part of my internship learning tasks. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic Python concepts such as data types, arithmetic operations, type casting, error handling, string concatenation, and dynamic typing.


---

🧠 Concepts Covered

1. Variable Declaration & Data Types

Integer (int)

Floating-point (float)

String (str)

Boolean (bool)



2. Printing Values and Their Types

Using the built-in type() function to display data types.



3. Arithmetic Operations

Addition

Multiplication

Division



4. Type Casting (Type Conversion)

Converting string input to:

Integer using int()

Float using float()




5. Error Handling

Using try-except block to handle invalid user input gracefully.



6. String and Number Concatenation

Converting numbers to strings using str() before concatenation.



7. Dynamic Typing in Python

Assigning different data types to the same variable at runtime.
